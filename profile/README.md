# FUTR Labs

FUTR Labs aims to fuel the Generative AI boom by creating a decentralized GPU network, powered by GPU cards sitting idle at home.

What does this currently mean? 

1. Generative AI companies post work to our API, and poll our API for their job status until the work is completed.

2. Gamers, Crypto Miners, and Generative AI enthusiasts run a simple docker container that uses the GPU to perform workloads. 


## Discord 

Come join the network, meet other ComfyUI artists and Generative AI enthusiasts, get support from the FUTR Labs team, and more at our Discord here:

## Tools

To accomplish our goal of eliminating the GPU shortage (or proving it never existed in the first place) we're open-sourcing several
tools that will make it simpler for artists and enthusiasts to use open-source generative AI software. 

These tools will all be able to join the GPU network to earn while idle. 

### [ComfyUI-Magic](https://github.com/FUTRlabs/ComfyUI-Magic)

An open-source docker container that makes it dead simple to install ComfyUI on any computer with an NVIDIA card and Windows or Linux.

View installation instructions, requirements, and more information in the repository.

### LLM-Magic (Coming Soon)

An open-source docker container that makes it dead simple to install and run Open-Source LLMs at home. 

Currently under heavy development. Alpha testing will begin soon. 

### Discord Bot (Coming Soon)

A simple discord bot that allows the users in your discord community access to run any workflow you desire on our GPU network. 

To receive a split of the profit of the workflows run in your community, please contact us.

## Collaboration

We are looking to work with generative ai companies that need a better, more flexible way to run their ai workloads. 

We want to elevate the ComfyUI artists, developers, and creators powering the Generative Art boom. 

We want to work with developers who are passionate about decentralized and distributed workloads.
